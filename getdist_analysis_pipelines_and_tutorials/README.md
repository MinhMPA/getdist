# Example pipelines for MCMC analysis using `GetDist`

This folder collects my own examples of how I build pipelines to analyze MCMC chains with `getdist`. They include how to extract and pack MCMC outputs into a `getdist`-friendly format, or how to estimate significance (and tension) metrics from `getdist.mcsamples.MCSamples` instances, etc.

Hope you find some of these helpful! All errors are mine. Suggestions and contributions welcome! [nhat.minh.nguyen.111\@gmail.com](mailto:nhat.minh.nguyen.111@gmail.com?subject=getdist-Examples)
